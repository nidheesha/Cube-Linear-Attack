This is the implementation code for the cryptography publication on linear cryptanalysis "Novel techniques in Linear Cryptanalysis" 

It takes a linear approximation equation and performs a cube attack on the approximate equation.
The keys obtained are substitued back on the equation and an algorithm is applied to obtain a better linear approximation.
These linear approximations reveal more keys.

The code takes the linear approximation equation and the degree of the equation as the primary parameters
